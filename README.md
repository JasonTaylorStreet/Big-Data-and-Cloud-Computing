# Big-Data-and-Cloud-Computing
This course is designed to provide students with a deep understanding of big data and cloud computing. The data storage and retrieval techniques that have served the information processing industry for decades have proven inadequate in the face of the huge collections of data. Businesses are requiring a new set of technologies that are specifically designed to deal with these huge data sets. This course will focus on applications of big data and cloud computing techniques that will be used to process large-scale data sets.
